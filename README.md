# PredictHeartDisease

In this project, I implement the random forest algorithm from scratch on a heart disease dataset (source: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).

Usage: 
* To develop models, run the 'main' script and follow prompts
* To change the hyperparameters of the random forest algorithm, go to line 88 in main.py
